## Client-Server-RockPaperScissors
##Simple rock paper scissors game using Java Client/Server interactions

###Basics of Java Client/Server socket connections
*Step 1: Create client/server sockets respectively using the ServerSocket and Socket classes
*Step 2: Server side accept client connection
*Step 3: Create input streams and output streams using whatever Reader/Writer you prefer
*Step 4: Set up application user interactions with server following in/out lines respectively
*Step 5: Continue following interactions closely, writing out when necessary
*Step 6: Remember to close sockets whenever finished

**Remember to listen on open ports 
**Remember to use a correct testing host to test the server (ie, localhost)

That's the basic setup!

####Result

A simple client/server user interaction using a rock, paper, scissors method/game

####Known Glitches
-While loops not generated, so once the game is over user must run both the Server/Client drivers respectively
-Once the game is over connection is closed for security purposes of the project test
-If an invalid choice is entered other than "rock", "paper", or "scissors" (case insensitive) program will exit
